# Challenge 5 Work Day Scheduler

## My Task

I ned to create a calendar that allows a user to save events for each hour of a 9 to 5 workday by modifying starter code.

As directed I used [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am and 5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following GIF demonstrates the goal application functionality:

## Future Improvements

I would like to add a feature that clears the saved events when it is a new day
